# The Kong Initiative Tictail theme

This is a Sinatra app we use to do local development of the theme for [The Kong Initiative](http://www.konginitiative.com). It speeds up development by downloading your Tictail store data and let's you develop on your local machine instead of being stuck with the code editor on Tictail.

Be curious and try it! If you want to use yourself you'll have to change some stuff. Most likely in the `Gruntfile.js`. You'll figure it out…

Questions? Just [open an issue](https://github.com/kollegorna/kong-tictail-theme/issues).

This app is originally a fork of [javve/tictail-theme-builder](https://github.com/javve/tictail-theme-builder) so hats of to [@javve](https://twitter.com/javve) for sharing this in the first place!
We've improved it by making a lot of changes of the Ruby code and some other stuff to make it fit how we do things here at [Kollegorna](https://labs.kollegorna.se).

[The Kong Initiative](http://www.konginitiative.com) is an online store bringing you the widest snowboards around to the EU. We'll give you free shipping, great service and lots of joy.
